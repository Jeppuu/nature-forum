# About the app
Nature Forum is a simple forum application, where users can ask and answer nature related questions or start up discussions. Users are able to comment on the posts, sharing their knowledge of the species. Users can add reactions on posts and give their support to the op.

Posts are divided into categories, such as insects, animals and plant, and they can be used to filter the posts seen on a userâ€™s main feed. Users can choose to view either all posts, or their own posts, with filter options.

This application requires registration and cannot be viewed without logging in first. However the app only stores each users username and salted password, so there's no need to worry about privacy with emails, for example.

This application is made for people who enjoy nature and discussion. It provides users with less knowledge of nature (or just a certain species) a place to find answers and learn, but also presents users with more knowledge a place to share their wisdom. And to all users a place to enjoy the wonders of nature!

This application is built using Next.js, React, MongoDB and mongoose.If you wish to clone the app, just make sure to run `npm i`on the CLI and follow up with `npm run dev`. You will also need to create a .env file for mongoDB and NextAuth credentials.
